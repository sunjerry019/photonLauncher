\section{Brief description}

Single mode fiber, operating wavelength 633 to 780 nm, 0.10 to 0.14 NA.  Wavelength range is for HeNe laser operating at 632.8 nm.

Attenuation as a function of wavelength unavailable on Thorlabs page.

SM600 Fiber: \url{https://www.thorlabs.com/thorcat/12600/12606-S01.pdf}

Wavelength range is the spectral region between cutoff wavelength and the bend edge. It represents the region where fiber transmits in the TEM$_{00}$ mode with low attenuation. For this fiber, bend edge wavelength is typically 200nm longer than the cut-off wavelength.

%What the devil. We can fix anything. Those great big fluffy clouds. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Put it in, leave it alone. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

%Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. This is the fun part How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.
