\section{Brief description}

Single mode fiber, operating wavelength 488 to 633 nm, 0.10 to 0.14 NA.  Wavelngth range is for the mercury light source, which has a spectral peak at 546.1 nm.

Attenuation as a function of wavelength unavailable on Thorlabs page.

%What the devil. We can fix anything. Those great big fluffy clouds. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Put it in, leave it alone. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

%Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. This is the fun part How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.
