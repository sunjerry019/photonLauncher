\section{Brief description}
\subsection{Fiber cap}

2.5 mm diameter ferrules, applies for Thorlabs FC/PC connectors, ST, and SC. Plastic. 25 per pack.

\subsection{Cleaning tissue}
25 sheets per booklet, 5 booklets.

Fold with the metal foreceps and wooden tweezers. Apply cleaning solution, and apply gently onto the optical surface, and gently wipe from the center.

Do not use hands to touch the cleaning tissue; it sorts of defeats the purpose of having one.

Drawing unavailable.

\subsection{Cottonbuds}

100 per pack. Not recommended for use with Acetone, not sure why. If it's not recommended, I'm also not sure why they sell it in the first place. For use with isopropanol maybe?

\subsection{Edmundoptics optical cleaning solution}

No volatile organic compounds. Apparently. Solvent-free.

Experience suggests its a bit slower to evaporate / not the greatest in cleanign off oil and dust.

No drawings nor meaningful specs available.
%What the devil. We can fix anything. Those great big fluffy clouds. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Put it in, leave it alone. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

%Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. This is the fun part How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.
