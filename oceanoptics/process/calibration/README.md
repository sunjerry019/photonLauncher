Wavelengths are calibrated using the pixel number as the X, plugged into the polynomial
    => Output units = nm
The wavelengths outputted to the file using wavelength files in the `/helpers/` folder are purely for reference and is different for each spectrometer. Please use with caution

Non-linearity is calibrated by substituting the pixel value into the polynomial
    => output = correction factor
    Multiply this factor
